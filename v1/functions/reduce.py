The reduce(fun,seq) function is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along.This function is defined in “functools” module.


At first step, first two elements of sequence are picked and the result is obtained.
Next step is to apply the same function to the previously attained result and the number just succeeding the second element and the result is again stored.
This process continues till no more elements are left in the container.
The final returned result is returned and printed on console.

reduce() vs accumulate() 

Both reduce() and accumulate() can be used to calculate the summation of a sequence elements. But there are differences in the implementation aspects in both of these.  

reduce() is defined in “functools” module, accumulate() in “itertools” module.
reduce() stores the intermediate result and only returns the final summation value. Whereas, accumulate() returns a iterator containing the intermediate results. The last number of the iterator returned is summation value of the list.
reduce(fun, seq) takes function as 1st and sequence as 2nd argument. In contrast accumulate(seq, fun) takes sequence as 1st argument and function as 2nd argument.

Reduce function i.e. reduce() function works with 3 parameters in python3 as well as for 2 parameters. To put it in a simple way reduce() places the 3rd parameter before the value of the second one, if it’s present. Thus, it means that if the 2nd argument is an empty sequence, then 3rd argument serves as the default one.
